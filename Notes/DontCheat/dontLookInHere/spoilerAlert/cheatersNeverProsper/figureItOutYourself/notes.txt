1st Route: Buttons don't work
    - check what is being passed to the update function

2nd Route: Object can't be React child Error
    - Function is a decoy. Check what is being passed in the JSX setState function

3rd Route: 3 Part debugging. 
    1. Error in console
    2. JSX won't show up
    3. code to blank input isn't working 
        - must have top level element wrapping JSX 
        - check router.js 
        - input doesn't have value tied to state
